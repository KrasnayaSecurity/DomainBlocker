DomainBlocker
=============

Blocks domains by adding them to the hosts file and directing them to Google.
The purpose of this software is to prevent access to malicious or indoctrinating
web sites.  Whether a website constitutes justified blocking on indoctrination
grounds is not universally agreeable.  If you feel that a website should not be
blocked on such grounds, please open a new issue and request that it be unblocked.
We seek to avoid censorship and only choose to block indoctrinating websites
where societal harm could likely result.

Installation
